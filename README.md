## Controling the media player with Hand Detection form scratch to professional
Project 1:

Hi there,
Here I am working on "Control_media_player_with_Hand_Detection_using_OpenCV".

To control the media player with Hand Detection using OpenCV:

1. For the Hand detection we created a haar cascade with the help of positive and negative images and train those images to recognize the Hand. But it is not accurately showing the best result when we created. So, we try to fist the haar cascade files for controlling the media player. Using that file when the fist is detected it needs to give the binary value as “1” and no hand detected it needs to give the value as “0”.

Those who have any queries regarding the project comment me or mail me.
